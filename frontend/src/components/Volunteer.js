            Whether or not you can code, you can help a local club in just a few hours a month! Dojos need general volunteers, and mentors for sessions. Even mentors donâ€™t have to have technical skills, because they help the young people mainly by encouraging them to discover their own way forward. <br />
When I see them doing things on their own, getting their ideas out there, and seeing creativity spur out of the moment, really gives me so much joy
