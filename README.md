# IMPORTANT
Please, add yourself to [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) whenever you add code to this code base to get credit where credit is due!

# Work flow
This project is set up for a gitflow:ish workflow. Never push directly to main or development branches. Instead, clone/pull development branch, create a new feature-branch `git checkout -b feature/my-cool-changes` and push your changes in this branch.

When your new cool feuture is done, open a pull request towards the development branch, and tag someone if you want a code review before merge.
